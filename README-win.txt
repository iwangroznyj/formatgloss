Formatgloss
===========


## Description ##

The linguistic software Toolbox can produce interlinearised glosses of data
acquired during fieldwork.  However glosses containing combining diacritics are
often misaligned.

The present script scans text files for Toolbox glosses and realigns them
taking diacritics into consideration.  It comes with a command-line interface
as well as a graphical user interface written in wxPython.


## Usage ##

Command-line interface:

    formatgloss_cli.exe file

Graphical user interface:

    formatgloss.exe
